## Abstract

1. Motivation: Verify Chern-Simons Theory which suggest there is gravitational wave (GW) amplitude birefringence.
2. GW amplitude birefringence is a property of space that enhance one polarisation and suppress another during propagation of GW.
3. By performing parameter estimation on GW event in GWTC-3, the third LIGO-Virgo catalog, we can constrain the strength of birefringence.
4. What's new? Previous studies usually assume birefringence is frequency independent, which is preliminary assumption. We include the frequency dependence, which allows us to further constrain the strength of birefringence
