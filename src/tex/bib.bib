    abstract = "{Parity-violating (PV) gravity has recently attracted interest in several aspects. One of them is the axion–graviton coupling to test the axion–dark matter model. Moreover, by extending Chern–Simons (CS) gravity to include derivatives of a scalar field up to the second order, a more general class of PV gravity theory, which we call the CNCL model, has been proposed [M. Crisostomi et al., Phys. Rev. D, 97, 044034 (2018)]. The model can be further extended by including even higher derivatives of the scalar field and/or higher curvature terms.In this paper, we discuss the effect of parity violation in the gravitational sector on the propagation of gravitational waves from binary coalescence by introducing a model-independent parametrization of modification. Our parametrization includes the CNCL model as well as CS gravity. The effect of parity violation on the gravitational waveform is maximum when the source binary orientation to our line of sight is edge-on, while the modified waveform reduces to the parity-symmetric one when the source is face-on. We perform a search for the signature of such modification by using the LIGO/Virgo O1/O2 catalog. We find that the catalog data is consistent with general relativity and obtain constraints on parity violation in gravity for various post-Newtonian order modifications for the first time. The obtained constraint on CS gravity is consistent with the results in previous works. On the other hand, the constraint on the CNCL model that we obtain is tighter than the previous results by roughly 7 orders of magnitude.}",

abstract = {Einstein's general relativity, as the most successful theory of gravity, is one of the cornerstones of modern physics. However, the experimental tests for gravity in the high energy region are limited. The emerging gravitational-wave astronomy has opened an avenue for probing the fundamental properties of gravity in a strong and dynamical field, and in particular, a high energy regime. In this work, we test the parity conservation of gravity with gravitational waves. If the parity symmetry is broken, the left- and right-handed modes of gravitational waves would follow different equations of motion, dubbed as birefringence. We perform full Bayesian inference by comparing the state-of-the-art waveform with parity violation with the compact binary coalescence data released by LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We do not find any violations of general relativity, thus constrain the lower bound of the parity-violating energy scale to be 0.09 GeV through the velocity birefringence of gravitational waves. This provides the most stringent experimental test of gravitational parity symmetry to date. We also find third generation gravitational-wave detectors can enhance this bound to  GeV if there is still no violation, comparable to the current energy scale in particle physics, which indicates gravitational-wave astronomy can usher in a new era of testing the ultraviolet behavior of gravity in the high energy region.}
